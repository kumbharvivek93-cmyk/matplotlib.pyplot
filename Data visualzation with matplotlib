TREE CONCEPT OF THE DATA VISUALZATION WITH MATPLOTLIB:
<<< ONE THING BRO PANDAS+MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT = NO WORDS HOW THE RIZZ AND POWER IS GODLL

# FOR PLOTING THE GRAPH WE USE PLOT() FUNCTION
# FOR MAKING TITLE AND LABELING WE USE LABEL() FUNCTION
# FOR MAKING GRID LINES WE USE GRID() FUNCTION 
# FOR PLOTING THE BAR GRAPHS WE USE THE BAR() FUNCTION 
# FOR PLOTING THE PIE CHARTS WE USE THE PIE() FUNCTION 

FOR USING EACH OF THE ABOVE FUNCTION WE SHOULD DO 

MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT.FUNCTION_NAME()   // SYNTAX OF USING EACH FUNCTION 
   *** OR IF WE MADE THE ALIES FOR THE MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT AS PLT THEN
PLT.FUNCTION_NAME()          // RECOMENDED SYNTAX

FOR EVERYFUNCTION REGARDIONG THE EVERY GRAPH AND DIAGRAM WE CAN USE OR PASS SELECTED USEFUL ARRGUMENTS NOTE IT 
THERE SO MANY USEFUL INFO REGARDING EACH FUNCTION AND GREAPH AND ALL LIKE COLORS , EXPLODE_NO_LIST FOR THE PIE CHARTS 

>>> SOMETIMES WORKING WITH THE SACTERGRAPHS AND OTHER GRAPHS WE FACE A COMMON PROBLEM THAT THE LABES ON X AXIS ARE GET CROWDED AND LOOKS VERY BAD
SO I CAME WITH A KINDA REALLY GOOD SOLUTION >>>

        1.PLT.TIGHT_LAYOUT
        2.PLT.XTICS(ROTATION=45,HA="RIGHT")
        3.PLT.FIGURE(FIGSIZE(18,3))   # FEEL FREEL TO CHANGE IT ACCORDING TO YOUR NEED  AND NOTE THAT WROTE THIS LINE BEFORE PLOTTING THE GRAPH 

ETC...
